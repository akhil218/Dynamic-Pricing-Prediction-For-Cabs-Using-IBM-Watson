# Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson

Every day the price of travel was changed due to the demand for public uses. The framework developed for the price prediction is analyzed for the travel plans. For the same travel plan offered at a fixed price for a particular group of customers, our proposed model saw a final fare with a lesser number of errors in predicting customer planning. As time progresses and more data are collected, the supervised learning will produce more accurate results and will be helpful in determining fare optimizer and dynamic availability of adjustments and continuously improve future recommendations.

* Built a Flask Application which calls HTML pages [index.html](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/templates/index.html), [index1.html](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/templates/index1.html), [result.html](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/templates/result.html) stored in the [templates](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/tree/master/templates) folder and a python script [app.py](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/app.py) for server side scripting
* The model is built in the notebook [Dynamic-Price-Prediction-For-Cabs.ipynb.ipynb](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/Dynamic-Price-Prediction-For-Cabs.ipynb)
* The model is saved in [model.pkl](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/model.pkl).
* The static folder contains a css file which is  used in the html file.
* The flask app is denoted as [app.py](https://github.com/akhil218/Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson/blob/master/app.py)
